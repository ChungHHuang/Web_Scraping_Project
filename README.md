# Web_Scraping_Project

This web scraping project studies and analyzes the box-office between series and non-series movies.

Do you feel the number of movie series increase the last ten years? Nine out of the top ten domestic 
gross movies are sequels, live-action remakes or shared universe movie in 2019 before August. 

Even though there are many successful franchise movies, their production budgets are also incredibly high. 
Do those movies make more profit than other non-series movies? 
If yes, how much profit does an original film make so that the production companies decide to make a sequel? 
Furthermore, what makes a movie successes so that audiences are still willing to watch its sequel?

This project is going to answer the questions above by scraping the boxofficemojo.com, the-numbers.com, 
and rottentomatoes.com, and conducting data visualization, numerical analysis, 
natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis using Pandas.


Project.py is the python script of data manipulation and data visualization.

Project_first_part.ipynb and Project_NLP_part.ipynb are the script in jupyter notebooks version.  

Those three folders are the Scrapy projects that use to scrapy data from those three websites.

The csv files are the data after web scraping.
